Since 2009, not books but a database of electronic documents created, authenticated, secured, and maintained by the Reporter of Decisions constitutes the "official report." The state Supreme Court proclaimed Arkansas to be the first jurisdiction in the nation to switch from law report publication to official legal data distribution.

More recently, the Arkansas judiciary upgraded its website with a new platform offering intuitive search interface that both eases and speeds advanced legal research. The new site drastically improves the usability of the Arkansas Judiciary opinions database. In total this is 75,000 official and unofficial opinions that are made available on the Arkansas Judiciary website, including Court of Appeal Opinions rendered since 1981 and Supreme Court opinions rendered since 1837. The Judiciary also recently added Court Rules and Administrative Orders to the site.

The Judiciary self-publishes all contents on the site. The processes are assisted by publishing automation tools making the content management process easy and efficient.
