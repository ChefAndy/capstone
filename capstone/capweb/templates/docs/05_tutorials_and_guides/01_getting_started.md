meta_description: Caselaw Access Project Getting Started Guide.
explainer: Want to get started with data from the Caselaw Access Project but aren't sure where to start? This guide will point you in the right direction for your use case.

This document will guide you through the process of determining what level of access you need to access the data you're interested in for your research. It will explain the pros and cons of unmetered research access and how to apply for it.

Our data is available in several forms, from a few different sources. Some are completely unrestricted and don't even require a login or API access token. Others are limited to a certain number of cases per day for users with regular logins. We will waive these limits for academic researchers, but our doing so requires signing a researcher agreement contract, limiting the redistribution of case data. 

To get started, you should first figure out:
What kind of data do you need? 
Just metadata? 
Full case text? 
From a specific jurisdiction? 
From specific years?
From any years after 1923?
How do you need to access it?
Do you need to programmatically query our [API]({% url 'docs' 'general/api/api' %}) ?
Do you need to download data in bulk?
Do you need to view cases in your browser?
What level of access does your use case require?
Do you need access to full case text or just metadata about the cases?
If you do need full case text, can you limit your usage to less than 500 cases per day?
