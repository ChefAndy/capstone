title: Reporting Problems
meta_description: Reporting Problems


We are serving an imperfect, living dataset through tools that will forever be works-in-progress. We work hard to hunt 
down and fix problems, but a robust user base will uncover problems more quickly than our small team could ever hope to.
Here's the best way to report common types of errors.
  
* [Our data errata](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone#errata)
* [Our issue tracker](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/issues)
* [Our Github repository](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone)


Jumbled or Misspelled Words in Case Text:
{: class="list-header mb-1" }

For now, we're not accepting bug reports for [OCR]({% url 'docs' 'user_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-ocr) 
problems. While our data is good quality for OCR'd text, we fully expect these errors in every case.  We're working on 
the best way to tackle this.
